# Pedal Pal 
## Introduction
This application is made as a course project of the course CS253: Software Development and Operations, Winter 2024, under the guidance of [Prof. Indranil Saha](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/isaha/). 

PedalPal aims to enhance the cycling experience for IITK students through a convenient and efficient bicycle-sharing system on campus. It allows easy bicycle access to the campus residents via strategically placed cycle-hubs install across the campus. The salient features of our application are - 
- Users can choose and ride a cycle instantly by scanning the QR code present on it
- Users can book a cycle to be used in the future, by paying a nominal cost to reserve the cycle. (This feature is only allowed for subscribed members)
- Subscribed users are provided with an in-app wallet to facilitate hassle-free payments
- Users can view the details of all the hubs present in the campus on a map
- Users can view their ride history and analytics like total time used, etc.

Intended audience of the application - IITK campus community and visitors
